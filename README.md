# RememberStates

The app designed with 'turtle' library

Try to remeber states of US and enter the name in the popup widndow. If you enter the word correctly(lower, uppercase - doesn't matter) it will appear on the map.
In case you give up and can't remember the remaining states, automatically all the remaining states will be added to external file called "RemainingStates.csv".
